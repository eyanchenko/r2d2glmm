# r2d2glmm


R code for prior distributions and generalized beta prime (GBP) approximations based on the paper "The R2D2 prior for generalized linear mixed models" [arxiv link]. Codes include: PDF, CDF and quantile function for priors which induce prior R2 ~ Beta(a,b); and function to find best fitting GBP distribution to prior. Also included are several examples of how to implement the methods. Please cite the paper if you use these codes.
