# r2d2glmm

R code for methods based on the paper "The R2D2 prior for generalized linear mixed models" [arxiv link]. Codes include: PDF, CDF and quantile function for prior distributions which induce prior R2 ~ Beta(a,b); and function to find best fitting generalized beta prime (GBP) distribution to the prior. Also included are several examples of how to implement the methods. Please cite the paper if you use these codes.
