R code for methods based on the paper "The R2D2 prior for generalized linear mixed models" https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.10718 by Eric Yanchenko, Howard D. Bondell and Brian J. Reich. Codes include: PDF, CDF, quantile function and random number generator for generalized beta prime (GBP) distribution; functions to go from W to R2 and R2 to W; PDF, CDF and quantile function for R2D2 prior distributions which induce prior R2 ~ Beta(a,b); and function to find best fitting GBP distribution to the prior. Also included are several examples of how to implement the methods. Please cite the paper if you use these codes.
